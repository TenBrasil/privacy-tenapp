### 4. Measures for the security of personal data ###

We employ technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access and situations such as destruction, loss, theft, or alteration of such data.

The measures we use take into consideration the nature of the data, the context and purpose of the processing, the risks that a potential breach would pose to the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the current standards employed in the market by similar companies to ours.

Among the security measures adopted by us, we highlight the following:

• Personal data is stored in a secure environment;

• Access to our database is limited, so that unauthorized third parties cannot access it;

• We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate to encrypt the transmission of data between users' devices and our servers;

• We keep records of everyone who has any kind of contact with our database.

Although we take all necessary measures to prevent security incidents, it is possible that a problem may occur exclusively due to a third party, such as in the case of hacker or cracker attacks, or due to the exclusive fault of the user, for example, when the user transfers their data to a third party. Therefore, although we are generally responsible for the personal data we process, we disclaim responsibility in the event of exceptional situations like these, over which we have no control.

In any case, if any type of security incident occurs that may pose a risk or significant harm to any of our users, we will notify the affected parties and the National Data Protection Authority in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Law.

We do not assume any responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of third-party websites or services.

### 5. Legal basis for the processing of personal data ###

Each operation of personal data processing needs to have a legal basis, which is nothing more than a justification that authorizes it, as provided for in the General Data Protection Law.

All our activities of personal data processing have a legal basis that supports them, among those allowed by the legislation. More information about the legal bases we use for specific operations of personal data processing can be obtained from our contact channels, as informed at the end of this Policy.
